# PCB directory
This directory contains all the PCB files, needed for the Cockpit panel. An overview will be uploaded in future...


For better visualization of the PCB's view this project on [CADLAB.io](https://cadlab.io/project/23795/main/files/PCB/projects). 

## Remarks
The zip files in the individual project folders are used to manufacture the pcb's and contain the gerber files. These will not be updated frequently, so you better build your own gerber files for production.
